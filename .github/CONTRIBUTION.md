## Coding Style

Sakoo Uses a ___Custom Coding Style based on Symfony Standards___. This will be applied using the `PHPCSFixer` tool.
You can run `make stylefix` to set your code in our standards, automatically.

Also, this is one of our Code Integration (CI) pipeline steps.
So, if your code hasn't our standards, the CI pipeline will be failed.
