# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Welcome to the Sakoo PHP Web Framework (Core) project! We are committed to creating a community that values readability, simplicity, and maintainability. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all contributors and the importance of our shared values, as well as the consequences for
unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers, we pledge to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone can contribute to the Sakoo Framework. We believe that even a 1% improvement in the code is a significant step toward achieving clean, maintainable, and efficient software. We are here to learn
from each other, and mistakes are seen as opportunities for growth.

## Our Values

At the Sakoo Framework, we prioritize:

- **Readability:** Code should be easy to read and understand. This ensures that others can easily pick up where you left off and that the project remains maintainable in the long term.
- **Simplicity:** We strive to write simple and straightforward code, avoiding unnecessary complexity. Simple solutions are often the most effective and easiest to maintain.
- **Attention to Detail:** "Deamon is in Details." We believe that the smallest details matter and that obsessive attention to detail leads to better software. This means taking the time to get things right, no matter how small.
- **Customization Over Dependency:** We value writing systems from scratch to create a customized development experience and reduce dependencies on third-party libraries. This philosophy encourages deep understanding and control over the codebase.
- **Continuous Learning:** We are all here to learn from each other. Donâ€™t be afraid to make mistakes, as they are a crucial part of the learning process.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that align with our values include:

- **Incremental Improvement:** Contributing even small improvements to the codebase, recognizing that every bit of progress counts.
- **Clean and Simple Code:** Writing code that is readable and simple, keeping the overall architecture clean and maintainable.
- **Obsessive Attention to Detail:** Taking pride in the quality of your work by focusing on the finer details that contribute to a polished final product.
- **Supporting Customization:** Embracing the philosophy of reducing dependencies by writing customized code whenever possible.
- **Collaboration and Learning:** Sharing knowledge, providing constructive feedback, and helping others to learn from their mistakes.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Neglecting Code Quality:** Pushing code that is unnecessarily complex or lacks clarity without consideration for the rest of the team.
- **Disrespect for Attention to Detail:** Dismissing the importance of small details or cutting corners in a way that could degrade the quality of the project.
- **Discouraging Mistakes:** Making others feel bad for making mistakes or discouraging them from trying new approaches.
- **Over-reliance on Third-Party Libraries**: Overusing third-party libraries when a custom solution would be more appropriate for the project.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for upholding the standards outlined in this Code of Conduct. This includes reviewing contributions to ensure they align with our values of readability, simplicity, and attention to detail. Maintainers are also expected to provide constructive feedback and support
continuous learning within the community.

Maintainers have the authority to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not meet these standards and to take action against any behavior that is harmful to the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channels used by the Sakoo Framework community. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [pouyaaofficial@gmail.com](mailto:pouyaaofficial@gmail.com). All reports will be reviewed and addressed promptly, with confidentiality maintained as appropriate.

The project team is responsible for determining and enforcing consequences for any violations of this Code of Conduct.

## Attribution
